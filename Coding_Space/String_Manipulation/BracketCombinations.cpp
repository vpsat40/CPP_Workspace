 *  Difficulty: Hard
 *  Solutions: 2720
 *  Maximum Score: 15
 *
 *  Description: This challenge will require knowledge of basic mathematical combinations.
 *
 *  Have the function BracketCombinations(num) read num which will be an integer greater than or equal to zero,
 *  and return the number of valid combinations that can be formed with num pairs of parentheses.
 *
 *  For example, if the input is 3, then the possible combinations of 3 pairs of parenthesis, namely:
 *  ()()(), are ()()(), ()(()), (())(), ((())), and (()()). There are 5 total combinations when the input is 3, so your program should return 5.
